Edit this readme to the needs of your project, but keep the bottom section explaining DUCK

In the repo there are 3 directories. Scripts, Docs, Tests.

In most situations there should be contents in all 3 directories. 
If the package is small enough the documentation can be in this readme.
If you use the Docs directory, please provide links from the readme for easy navigation and between the pages of documentation if possible.

Rename the following files & their change their content, so the assembly name matches the file name
`Scripts/Sundog.MyPackage.asmdef`
`Tests/Sundog.MyPackage.Tests.asmdef`

The following files are for example purposes and can be reused or removed.

`Examples/ExampleScript.cs` & `Tests/ExampleScript.Tests.cs`
